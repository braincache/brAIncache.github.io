### Coding the intersection of generational thinking, technology, and AI

We are the music makers,\
    And we are the dreamers of dreams,\
Wandering by lone sea-breakers,\
    And sitting by desolate streams;\
World-losers and world-forsakers,\
    On whom the pale moon gleams:\
Yet we are the movers and shakers\
    Of the world for ever, it seems\
                         - Arthur O'Shaughnessy
