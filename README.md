### WELCOME...

Our intent is clear, delivering high signal content that remains objective and flexible to updating. We are not some productivity hack, nor are we seeking to be right. 
<br>
<br>
We seek to LEARN, UNDERSTAND & BUILD BRIDGES. 
<br>
<br>
Bridges between old and young, tech and business, business and society, left and right, neighbor to neighbor. We are more connected than any group of humans in our known history, so we think, yet feel more disjointed than ever.<br>

**Our Mission:**
Emit a high signal frequency at the intersection of thinking, data, and technology. <br>

**Our Objective:**
Scour the digital age identifying signals in the sea of information. Using our understanding of Data Science, Machine Learning, Artificial Intelligence,  & Technology, connecting our societal & philosophical thoughts, with hard data. Pushing our thoughts further along the edge of the 'tree of knowledge'.
<br>

Feel free, as a matter a fact, we encourage you to challenge our thoughts. The point is not to be right, it's to be iterative on and in our thinking. 


We are the music makers,\
    And we are the dreamers of dreams,\
Wandering by lone sea-breakers,\
    And sitting by desolate streams;\
World-losers and world-forsakers,\
    On whom the pale moon gleams:\
Yet we are the movers and shakers\
    Of the world for ever, it seems\
                         - Arthur O'Shaughnessy
